ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Amani.

ğŸŒŒ I have a keen interest in space science and astrophysics research.

ğŸ’» Currently, I'm enhancing my skills in Python and C programming languages.

ğŸ”¬ One of my early projects involved working with FITS files to extract temperature readings from publicly available data on the NGC 3576 emission nebula.
